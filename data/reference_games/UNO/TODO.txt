TODO: Make hand functionality
Hand: Like stack but more freedom on cards, cards can be taken out from any part
Like stack, hand controls card positioning
Hand cannot be moved, fixed in place

Make definition of hand in JSON
- Location, size

- Add stack to hand
- Add card to hand
- OPTIONAL: Convert hand to stack (right click menu)
- Remove specific card from hand by hovering over it

Work on deal command:
- Basic mode deals out cards based on stack, how many for each player, and how many players.
- Specify which hand each set of cards goes to based on player

TODO: Add multi-select (ease of use, could move to another patch)



Optional: Player perspective mode
- Let player.json set perspective for each player
